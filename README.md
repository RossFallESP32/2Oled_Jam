# üì° 2OLED Jam Device ‚Äì RF Jamming Interface with ESP32

This project is a dual-bus RF jamming controller built around the ESP32 platform. It uses two OLED displays to provide a user interface and real-time feedback on RF channel activity across two independent RF24 modules (HSPI and VSPI).

## üß© Features

- **Dual OLED Display (0.96")**  
  - Primary screen: Menu navigation and mode selection  
  - Secondary screen: Real-time RF channel status for both radios

- **RF24 Dual Bus Control**  
  - Independent control over HSPI and VSPI RF modules  
  - Supports multiple jamming modes

- **User Input Interface**  
  - 4 physical buttons: UP / DOWN / OK / BACK  
  - EEPROM saves last selected mode

- **Idle Animation**  
  - Displays alternating bitmap images when idle for more than 10 seconds

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Power Up**  
   Connect the ESP32, OLEDs, RF modules, buttons, and battery as shown in the circuit diagram.

2. **Navigate Menu**  
   - Use UP/DOWN buttons to scroll through options  
   - Press OK to select a mode  
   - The selected mode is saved to EEPROM

3. **Start Jamming**  
   - Enter the Jam or Test menu  
   - Press OK to toggle jamming ON/OFF  
   - The secondary OLED displays current RF channels for both radios

4. **Idle Mode**  
   - If no input is detected for 10 seconds, the secondary screen shows alternating idle images
